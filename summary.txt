AccountControllerTest
>> getExistingAccount -- This test case fails because password is exposed. Excepted was NULL but was TEST.
	In the Account resource Annotate the get password with @JsonIgnore
	varies with Jackson version
	
>> createAccountNonExistingUsername -- this basically creates account
	 we are going to add Mockito feature called Argument Captor
	 which allows us to see particular kind of object that was passed to createAccount function on a mock object
	 
	 Create a variable of ArgumentCaptor and initiate in @Before method with forClass of ArgumentCaptor
	 
	 Use verify method of Mockito and pass our service and then createAccount method ( verfiy allows us to verify whether a method was called at all or not)
	 
	 use ArgumentCaptor to store password and assert it ; test fails due to jackson version and json ignore
	 now to go setpassword and add JSON Property to set method; this will tell that password is a property and we want to only ignore getPassword
	 
	 
>> createBlogExistingBlogName -- throws BlogExistsExcpetion 

	 Its a service layer exception , we want rest layer exception
	 Goto Account Controller , were Blog is created
	 and add catch for BlogExistsExcpetion
