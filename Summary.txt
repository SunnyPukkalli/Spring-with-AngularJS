Tutorial 4

Spring HATEOAS is added to the project to provide HATEOAS constraint to RESTFULL RESOURCES.

basically we can inject links into  restful resources --> ResourceSupport and ResourceAssemblerSupport

PathVariable for binding Java variables into request URL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

public @ResponseBody BlogEntry test(@RequestBody BlogEntry entry)

we will not be using BlogEntry back/forth for JSON ,instead 
we will be using BlogEntryResource which will be external representation of internal BlogEntry Entity.


BlogEntryResource extends ResourceSupport Class of HATEOAS

Add fields we want to display publically when converted to JSON via JACKSON
And also the kind of data we want to recieve back from the client when they send a BlogEntryResource ( E.g. Title of the Blog)


We want to convert between BlogEntry and BlogEntryResource --> Resource Assembler Class of HATEOAS

BlogEntryResourceAsm --> class to assemble BlogEntryResource

Code Sample :- BlogEntryResourceAsm  extends ResourceAssemblerSupport<BlogEntry, BlogEntryResource>

1st parameter : what you're converting From 
2nd parameter : to our external representation

1)ResourceAssemblerSupport<BlogEntry, BlogEntryResource> ===> FROM BlogEntry TO BlogEntryResource
2) Create the constructor and call super method , 1st parameter will be controller class,2nd parameter will be resource class
3) implement the unimplemented methods and create a new BlogEntryResource and return the same.
