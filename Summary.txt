Setting up project to support JSON using JACKSON Library and how to test controllers using MOCKMVC in spring test module


Setup spring	so that JSON --> Java Object and also send back data using HTTP Response


	include MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter --> Add jackson to the Classpath and mvc-annotation driven to the classpath
	
	
	// Spring uses Message Converters to convert between HTTP requests and Java objects
	
	
	
	Search for jackson json library
	
	
	to test controllers add spring test dependencies and also servlet api dependency in test so that we can test outside servlet container
	
	
	mock mvc builders to set up controllers for test , there are 2 types :- 1) Standalone 2) webcontext
	
	
	MOCK MVC Request Builders class  so that we can use method chaining to build our request. 
	
	
	mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup(controller).build(); // this sets up and builds the request 
	
	
	mockMvc.perform(get("/test")).andDo(print());
	// this performs a GET Request with pattern /test  ; the method print() is used  print the response and all details related the HTTP Request.
	
	
	
	JSON PATH to check various parts of the object we're recieving   --> Include JSON PATH in Classpath 
  
  $ --> root element of JSON
